Human behaviour is fascinating. It is a noble pursuit to try gain a better understanding of things such as how we make decisions, the systems in which we make decisions, how we influence each other and how our individual choices translate into aggregate outcomes. In doing so, we gain new perspectives on a broad range of topics such as education, migration, health, labor and policy. As a guiding principle, I believe in having an open mind when exploring and a cautious mind when exploiting.

I'm a first-year __PhD student__ in __Economics__ at [Linnaeus University](https://lnu.se/en/meet-linnaeus-university/Organisation/school-of-business-and-economics/meet-the-school-of-business-and-economics/) and an affiliated doctoral student at the [Research Institute of Industrial Economics](https://ifn.se).

My research interests are in urban and __segregation__ studies, as well as __labor economics__ and applied microeconomics.
