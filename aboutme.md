## Guiding Principles ##
Human behaviour is fascinating. It is a noble pursuit to try gain a better understanding of things such as how we make decisions, the systems in which we make decisions, how we influence each other and how our individual choices translate into aggregate outcomes. In doing so, we gain new perspectives on a broad range of topics such as education, migration, health, labor and policy. As a guiding principle, I believe in having an open mind when exploring and a cautious mind when exploiting.

I'll upload this page sporadically and not on a specific schedule.
It's meant to be light and fun for both me and you. 
It's highly unconventional to write in a stream of thought manner like this.
But heck, why not? For just this part of the website, enjoy some hot mess.

Here's what this page contains right now:

## Seminar Participation ##
Have you ever wondered exactly how many presentations I have attended during my PhD?
I sure have. And I've done something about it.

Last updated 2023-11â€“19: Here are some plots for the seminars and brown bags that I have attended.

## Exploring the Lex Fridman Podcast ##
I love the Lex Fridman podcast. So I did some digging. The following is based on data from YouTube.

First, the podcast has had a lot of views. Over 400 million views.

Lex averages 5 days between episodes and has done so consistently for a few years now.

To get a feeling for what the podcast is about, let's look at its guests.
First, we have the most recurring interviewees. You can form your own opinion about them,
but I find the breadth of their fields fascinating. Physcists, programmers, philosophers, fighters, podcasters, teachers, and more!

The podcast's most viewed episodes (with over 12 million for first place).

So what do they discuss on these podcasts? Based off of the titles, here's the top 20 words and bigrams.
Basically, a lot of AI, physics, human nature, and our future.

Beyond the title, they must talk about several different stuff in the actual interview.
<!-- For the episodes with timestamps available, we can see the average number of topics per episode. -->
The length of the episode correlates positively with the length of the episode.
My favorite outlier is Balaji Srinivasan's episode, at an impressive 7 hours 47 minutes and 52 seconds.
