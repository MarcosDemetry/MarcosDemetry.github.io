Welcome to my personal webpage! I am currently a first year PhD student interested in urban economics, segregation studies and labor economics. Explore the website to find out about my [research](research.md), [teaching](teaching.md) and [work experience](resume.md) in academia.

To make you feel at home, this is the view from the hill close to where I live.
