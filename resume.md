  <summary>Summer 2017: Summer Research Assistant, <a href="https://ratio.se">Ratio Institute</a></summary>
  
There is a growing interest in understanding the causes and patterns of residential segregation in urban areas. I spent my summer researching on the theoretical explanations for the rise of segregation in the absence of discriminatory policy. The research resulted in a working paper titled "__Segregation in Urban Areas__", under the supervision of Ekon. Dr. [Martin Korpi](https://ratio.se/en/employees/martin-korpi/). The paper covers both a theoretical framework based on __Thomas Schelling__'s models of segregation and the empirical challenges of applying those models using observational and experimental data.

Labor strikes and other labor union action play a vital role in labor market outcomes. Within Ratio's multilayered analyses on the consequences of a __labor market conflict__, I contributed with descriptive statistics for the empirical analysis. The final product, by Professor [Nils Karlson] and Ida Knudsen, is titled "Kostnader och konsevenser av en arbetsmarknadskonflikt— en fallstudie av byggstrejken våren 2016."
