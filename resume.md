  <summary>Summer 2017: Summer Research Assistant, <a href="https://ratio.se">Ratio Institute</a></summary>

<p>

There is a growing interest in understanding the causes and patterns of residential segregation in urban areas. I spent my summer researching on the theoretical explanations for the rise of segregation in the absence of discriminatory policy. The research resulted in a working paper titled "<b>Segregation in Urban Areas</b>", under the supervision of Ekon. Dr. <a href="https://ratio.se/en/employees/martin-korpi/">Martin Korpi</a>. The paper covers both a theoretical framework based on <b>Thomas Schelling</b>'s models of segregation and the empirical challenges of applying those models using observational and experimental data.

Labor strikes and other labor union action play a vital role in labor market outcomes. Within Ratio's multilayered analyses on the consequences of a <b>labor market conflict</b>, I contributed with descriptive statistics for the empirical analysis. The final product, by Professor <a href="https://ratio.se/en/employees/nils-karlson/">Nils Karlson</a> and Ida Knudsen, is titled "Kostnader och konsevenser av en arbetsmarknadskonflikt— en fallstudie av byggstrejken våren 2016."
