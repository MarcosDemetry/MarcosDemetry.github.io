<p>

There is a growing interest in understanding the causes and patterns of residential segregation in urban areas. I spent my summer researching on the theoretical explanations for the rise of segregation in the absence of discriminatory policy. The research resulted in a working paper titled "<b>Segregation in Urban Areas</b>", under the supervision of Ekon. Dr. <a href="https://ratio.se/en/employees/martin-korpi/" target="_blank">Martin Korpi</a>. The paper covers both a theoretical framework based on <b>Thomas Schelling</b>'s models of segregation and the empirical challenges of applying those models using observational and experimental data.

Labor strikes and other labor union action play a vital role in labor market outcomes. Within Ratio's multilayered analyses on the consequences of a <b>labor market conflict</b>, I contributed with descriptive statistics for the empirical analysis. The final product, by Professor <a href="https://ratio.se/en/employees/nils-karlson/" target="_blank">Nils Karlson</a> and Ida Knudsen, is titled "Kostnader och konsevenser av en arbetsmarknadskonflikt— en fallstudie av byggstrejken våren 2016."

## <ins> Non-Academic Work Experience</ins>
As important as it is to showcase experience from academia, it is equally important to highlight real-world experience. My previous non-academic work experience includes: waiting tables at cafés, telemarketer, busboy at a restaurant, Youth Leader at St Mary and St Paul Coptic Orthodox Church, as well as the occasional English/Math tutoring at public libraries or privately.
