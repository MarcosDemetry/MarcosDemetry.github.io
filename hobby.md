## Beautifully Unnecessary Statistics (BUS)

I enjoy anything to do with data. This often involves gathering data (from receipts, transactions, or through web scraping and other bulk dataset downloads),
and visualizing data. The process itself is highly rewarding---any gained insight is just a plus.
I'll update this page sporadically and not on a specific schedule.
It's meant to be light and fun for both me and you. 
It's highly unconventional to write in a stream of thought manner like this.
But heck, why not? For just this part of the website, enjoy some hot mess.
Oh, I also post about books on Instagram with the handle [@Ceres_books](https://www.instagram.com/ceres_books/).
Welcome to my hobby!
