### Introduction to Microeconomics –– Linnaeus University (Spring 2023)
Five lectures for a first-year undergraduate course, focusing on __production theory__, competitive markets and monopolies.

### Advanced Microeconomics –– Linnaeus University (Autumn 2022)
Two lectures and an exercise session for a master's course, focusing on __welfare__, market inefficiencies, and __behavioral__ economics with applications to environmental sustainability.

### Intermediate Microeconomics –– Linnaeus University (Autumn 2022)
Two lectures and an exercise session for a second-year undergraduate course, focusing on externalities, public goods and __asymmetric information__.

### Microeconomics with Applications -- Uppsala University
Teaching Assistant for a second-year undergraduate course. My task was helping students navigate microeconomics and introducing them to game theory. The __mentoring__ took place through discussions with the students, __solving exercises on the board__, and __helping one-on-one__ in person or via e-mail. The mentorship took place __once a week__ and was three hours long.

Student feedback for my mentorship sessions were overwhelmingly positive; ranging from 4.0/5.0 in my first semester to __4.8/5.0__ in my third, and last, semester.

   Here's what attendance looked like for the three semesters I was a TA:

   One pattern that stands out is the relatively <b>high attendance</b> right <b>before</b> the students' <b>midterm</b> exam and the immediate dip right after said exam. Another interesting observation is the absolute number of participants being higher during the spring semester. From what I've heard, this is because the spring semester is when it is most convenient for non-econ students to enroll in this course as an elective. A third interesting observation is that the first and last session of each semester have the exact same number of students.

### Principles of Micro- and Macroeconomics, Uppsala University
Teaching Assistant for a first-year undergraduate course. As a seminar leader, I discussed and __evaluated term papers__ and presentations on economic theory and its applications by the students.
