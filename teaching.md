### Microeconomics with Applications, Uppsala University
__Teaching Assistant__ for the second-year course, B/Microeconomics with Applications. My task was helping students navigate microeconomics and introducing them to game theory. The __mentoring__ took place through discussions with the students, __solving exercises on the board__, and __helping one-on-one__ in person or via e-mail. The mentorship took place __once a week__ and was three hours long.

__Student feedback__ for my mentorship sessions were overwhelmingly positive; ranging from 4.0/5.0 in my first semester to __4.8/5.0__ in my third, and last, semester.

   Here's what attendance looked like for the three semesters I was a TA:

   One pattern that stands out is the relatively <b>high attendance</b> right <b>before</b> the students' <b>midterm</b> exam and the immediate dip right after said exam. Another interesting observation is the absolute number of participants being higher during the spring semester. From what I've heard, this is because the spring semester is when it is most convenient for non-econ students to enroll in this course as an elective.

### Principles of Micro- and Macroeconomics, Uppsala University
__Teaching Assistant__ for the first-year undergraduate course A/Principles of Micro- and Macroeconomics. As a seminar leader, I discussed and __evaluated term papers__ and __presentations__ on economic theory and its applications by the students. The students participated in __three seminars__ where they produced a paper on a topic of their choice within economic theory, and in the final seminar both presented and defended their paper.
