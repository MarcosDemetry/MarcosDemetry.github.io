## The Illusion
I tell myself that I am very productive most of the time. It's often not true. Yet, I find that there is some benefit to this illusion. Let me explain.

## The Sermon
I once heard a sermon by a bishop in the Coptic Church that said "to become a saint, you have to aspire to better yourself. Pretend. In the privacy of your home, pretend to be a saint. Pray, not because that is what you want to do, but because that's what saints do. Be kind to others, not because that's what you want to do, but because that's what saints do." I found this truly insightful (and I rarely find sermons insightful). I immediately understood that he's not saying "be a hypocrite", rather, "practice makes perfect". This message comes to mind in many aspects of life, and finally, it reached my view of productivity.

## Experiment
If only you could follow these 10 how-to steps, you will become a much more productive person. Or wait. Was it some other 6-step program to increase productivity? Self-help, I am convinced, comes only from experimentation and finding out what works for me. Otherwise, as some comedian said, it would just be called "help", not "self-help". So what have I experimented with over the years to boost my productivity—what works and what has failed miserably?

1. <b>Positive affirmation through daily logs</b>. I found that when I take (detailed) count of what tasks I have done today, I feel better about my accomplishments. This little ego-boost is a safe, non-harmful, way of getting a little encouragement to keep on being productive.
2. <b>Pomadoro technique</b>. The Pomadoro technique, as most of you know, means working for a prespecified amount of time and taking a mandatory break afterwords—rinse and repeat until satisifed. A day where I wake up energized, I go for the 50 minutes work and 10 minutes break (50/10). A day where I'm feeling a little less productive, I go for the 45/15. For those 50 (or 45) minutes, my iPhone is tucked away somewhere, I'm not on social media or distracted by much else. It's not much of a sacrafice either, because the next break is always "just around the corner". With the 45/15, you get 3 productive hours for each 4 hours. This is a level of productivity that I am rather satisifed with.
3. <b>Working ahead</b>. This is a bit of a guilty pleasure. I try to keep track of what projects I could be working on if I'm stuck or bored with the current project. Usually, I'll have a small hobby coding project or something else (read: this website) that I could spend my time on. Having too many side-projects gets me side-tracked, but having none makes me bored. While these side-projects aren't the most effective way of using my time, they still contribute to my knowledge or portfolio in one way or another.
4. <b>Tech and gadgets</b>. I can't help but be fascinated by gadgets. I always feel like if only I had the latest [enter cool product name here], I'd be more productive. I spend too much time reading specs for products I cannot afford. However, every once in a while, I know enough about a product and buy it and am productive just because I want to use it a lot (e.g. my new MacBook Pro).
5. <b>9 to 5</b>. Working 9 to 5 was what I did for many years. I have the luxury of being in a profession where I can be flexible with my working hours. I thought that waking up late would mean that I'm less productive. There's some truth to that. I realized, however, that I don't need to stick to the 9 to 5 just to be productive. For some weeks on end I stay up working late. Other times, I enjoy working very early in the morning. What works for me now is keeping a routine, but not being afraid to switch it up every few months.

## My New Normal
Inspired by the bishop's sermon, I now pretend to be productive—and it works. I ask myself, what would a productive person do now? The answer: stop writing this blog post and get back to work.
