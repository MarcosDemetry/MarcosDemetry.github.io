## Flirtatious People
One can reasonably assume that flirtatious people flirt with a lot of people. In some cases, they flirt with people to show their admiration. In other cases, they flirt simply because they are flirtatious.

If I am on the receiving end of a flirtatious person’s flirting, how do I tell whether that person is (i) genuinely interested in me or (ii) simply manifesting their flirtatious nature?

## Instinctive answer
A first-best guess is that someone that is naturally flirtatious is _not_ interested in me. Why? Because they are flirtatious with many people and they cannot be genuinely interested in many people (at least romantically). Conversely, flirtation from a person that is relatively reserved is more likely to be a sign of genuine interest. 

Of course, this is not always the case. This ties in nicely with the topic of statistical discrimination—which may shed some light on the issue. 

## Statistical discrimination
The typical example of statistical discrimination is in a labor market setting. An employer wants to hire a highly productive employee. They are faced with
two candidates for the position. One candidate belongs to a group that _on average_ has high productivity, while the other candidate belongs to a group that, on average, has low productivity. The employer, without any other information about the candidates except their group-belonging, would more often than not be better off selecting the candidate from the high productivity group.

Read that last sentence again. No where in the sentence do we mention anything about the candidates' productivity (perhaps, only to the extent that they contribute to their groups' productivity). The employer goes with the information they have, which is aggregated on the group level.

Following this rule of thumb, the employer will likely at some point hire a candidate from the high-productivity group that has a _lower_ productivity than the 
candidate from the low productivity group. Think of this like two normally distributed curves with some overlap in the middle. The overlap will contain the most productive individuals from the low productivity group and the least productive individuals from the high productivity group.

## Resolving both issues
One solution to the problem of statistical discrimination is by insuring that the employer finds out more about the candidates. This is accomplished by, for example, testing the candidates productivity directly and basing one's decision on the outcome of said tests. 

Similarly, with regards to flirtation, our instinctive answer would have been correct if the only thing we knew about the person was whether or not they are flirtatious. However, as soon as we get the chance to get to know the person, the relative importance of our direct interaction with them should outweigh our initial judgment of them based on group-belonging.

## Long-term effects of statistical discrimination
Self-fulfilling prophecy is a commonly discussed issue with statistical discrimination. Essentially, if an employer were to choose candidates from the group with an above-average productivity, it catalyzes a widening gap in productivity between the groups. Imagine that the candidate from the high-productivity group gets the job, although there is someone from the low-productivity group that in fact has a higher productivity than them. If we believe that getting this position somehow improves productivity (or qualifications) further, then the candidate that is hired will have a better chance at landing their next job (because their group average will be even greater than before), while the candidate that wasn't hired will have a worse chance of landing their next job. 

Similarly, if we were to assume that flirtatious individuals are _never_ genuinely interested in anyone, it is very likely that we ignore flirtatious people who 
 attempt to show genuine interest. When they actually want to show interest, they are easily dismissed. They go on living a shallow life (...it's deep...and dark... I know) never getting any true love reciprocated—and here's the important part—thus furthering their our image of them as simply flirtatious!

## Bigger picture
In fact, this point (as cliché as it may seem) applies to far broader aspects of life than the labor or dating market. Essentially, the more information we have
about an individual the less we are swayed by our stereotypes of that individual.

Practicing interactions with people allows us to tackle statistical discrimination _and_ not risk missing out on good candidates simply based on stereotypes.

If I am talking to someone, I have a preconceived notion of where I think our conversation is going. I also _think_ that I have an understanding of that person's lived experiences. Far too many times, I have been proven wrong. Whatever story we tell ourselves about how the world works, there are as many alternative stories as there are people in this world.

Nowadays I tell myself, by all means, have an informed opinion, but don't let that hinder you in understanding the person you're talking to.
