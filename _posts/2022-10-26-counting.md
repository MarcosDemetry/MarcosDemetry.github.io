## Personal data-gathering freak
That's me. I gather data about many aspects of my life. I've used the robot vacuum cleaner 22 times since August 8th, bought 17 boxes of coffee pods containing a total of 248 capsules since february 5th of this year, and so forth.

## Counting workout days
In any case, in an attempt to impress my gym rat friend, I wanted to show off how much I have exercised in the past few days. On Thursday the 20th of October, I counted that I had exercised 5 times in the last 7 days. For me, exercising 5 times in 7 days is very impressive! This translates to 0.71 workouts per day. Keep this statistic in mind.

In the figure below, each green dot represents a day where I have worked out.

Well, if I include Thursday the 20th in my calculation, then I'm down to having exercised 5 out of 8 days (or on average 0.625 workouts per day).
However, if a week is considered to be from Monday–Sunday, I had only exercised twice that week (2/7 = 0.286) and three times the week prior (3/7 = 0.426). That's not impressive at all.

## Base rates and the MAUP
In these scenarios, the number of times that I had worked out has not changed, but the period over which I am averaging my workouts is variable. In other words, 
my base rate changes.

More than that, my definition of a week also changes how many exercises are counted. When I let the week go from Thursday–Thursday, I had the maximum number of workouts included. In the physical calendar space, imagine that we could slice and dice different areas. For example, we could have a box around just the weekends, as in the image below. This is a highly unconventional way of counting days, but not impossible. I could have said to my friend that I have exercised on 3 of 4 weekend days.

The fact that changing the base rate or my definition of a week results in different ratios of workout days to non-workout days (e.g. 5/7 to 2/7, or 3/4 on weekends) is exactly what the segregation literature calls the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP).

## MAUP and neighborhood segregation
In calculating how segregated a neighborhood is, we need to define a neighborhood and have a comparison (or reference) area. For example, 
if we are interested in ethnic residential segregation, we would want to know the share of minority residents in this neighborhood relative to the share of minority residents in a larger area, such as the municipality, county, or nation. But which is it? Should we be comparing the composition in this neighborhood to the composition in the municipality, county or nation? 

The MAUP implies that this problem is threefold: scale, aggregation and reference area. These three problems are best illustrated in the figure below (taken from Hennerdal and Nielsen, 2017, p. 557). In this figure, the numbers represent a segregation index where high values imply high concentration of a specific group in the neighborhood.

The scale problem is most similar to our workout example. Since I exercised in a few consecutive days, if I keep my aggregation scale low, then that period will seem like I've had a very high average number of workouts per day. This is illustrated in the top panel of the figure above. The aggregation problem (as seen in the middle panel) is much like me deciding to count weekends versus weekdays. There are many ways to draw borders (i.e. define neighborhoods) that determine how segregated a neighborhood is. Finally, the bottom panel shows how our level of segregation changes based on what reference area we choose.

## What's the answer?
The MAUP shows the difficulties in answering that question unless segregation indices are calculated over several different aggregation levels or defintions of neighborhoods. No one statistic can give relay the full extent of residential segregation. It's a multifacted problem and requires multifaceted solutions.

Similarly, I was not wrong in telling my friend that I had an intense exercise period. It is however a period that is not representative of my exercising routines in general (see the beginning of October for lazy-me).

This example with the exercises schedule is stupid. It really is. It serves only one purpose, and that is to illuminate the much more interesting example of neighborhood segregation and MAUP. The main takeaway is that definitions matter, base rates matter, and oftentimes a statistic answers a very specific question which may bear an answer that differs from the answer to your more general question.

So next time I tell you I've been exercising a lot, call me out on my bullsh*t. Ask about base rates.
