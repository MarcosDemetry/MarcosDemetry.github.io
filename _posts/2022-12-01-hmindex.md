## Abstract
The Houtman-Maks index is a measure of the size of a violation of utility maximizing (i.e. rational) behavior. This 
note introduces the _Stata_ command __hmindex__, which calculates the Houtman-Maks index for a data set of 
prices and observed choices of a consumer. The command is illustrated with an empirical application.
