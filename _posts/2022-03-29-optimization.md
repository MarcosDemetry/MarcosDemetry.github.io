## Optimizing a thing that should simply not exist
"Possibly the most common error of a smart engineer, is to optimize a thing which does not exist. Why would people do that? Well, everyone has been trained in high-school and college that you have to answer the question[...] So you can't tell a professor  "your question is dumb" or you'll get a bad grade. You have to answer the question.

Everyone basically, without knowing it, has got a mental straight-jacket on—that is, they'll work on optimizing a thing that should simply not exist." - Elon Musk (https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lzRHTale4uo)

This highlights importance of knowing "what" to optimize before diving into "how" to optimize. Had we gone about optimizing horse carriages without considering alternative modes of transportation, we would have had amazing horse carriages but still no engine cars.

## Identity politics
Our identity is deeply tied to how society sees us. One aspect of that is what we are labelled as—for example, what our ethnicity is or what pronouns we use. It is clear that a mislabeling may have grave impacts on a person's well-being. However, I'd like to argue that a debate that focuses too much on labels and too little on solving deeply rooted and systemic problems is a well-meaning but misguided attempt at a solution.

With that in mind, listen to what John McWhorter says about the attitude of showing that you understand racism without actually doing anything to solve it. (Minute 16:20–18:27)

"A lot of the people that we're talking about are under the impression that showing that you understand that societal racisim exists is really key. They think that showing that you understand that is a necessary prelude to changing the world. ... Says who? ... The point hasn't been made in any mainstream way that we can say that all of those people who are pretending this know. It's just that it feels right, frankly, it's easy. __You stand up and show that you know something and everybody does high-fives__. __But what have you done for somebody who's suffering?__ No one really asks that question."

Both Elon Musk and John McWhorter are describing the same phenomenon but in different contexts. It really doesn't matter how much you can improve on a thing, if that's not an important thing to improve. Another layer to this argument (which is more relevant in McWhorter's reasoning) is that expanding our vocabulary of how we describe a problem becomes useless after a certain point, worse yet, gives us the illusion that we are working toward solving the problem.

## Information versus action
Information has not always been in abundance, as it is today. Just in my (rather short and still youthful) lifetime, I went from going to the library to look up information to only entering a library if I am in urgent need of a public toilet. When information (or more accurately, knowledge) was scarce, it had a high premium. Everyone was "doing something" (an action), but the few that could optimize an action by gaining knowledge received a hefty payoff. In contrast, today we find ourselves in possession of extravagant information. Yet, it seems like there are less people "doing things".

## Backseat driver
In many aspects I've become a backseat driver. I am sometimes fully convinced that I have sufficient expertise in something that i _could_ do it. This satisfies my urge _to do it_. I then read up about another topic, find myself with an incling of understanding of the intricacies of the topic, feel satisfied, and repeat. Thus, in many aspects, I have substituted __doing something valuable__ with __knowing the basics of how to do that something__.

As a thought experiment, I imagine a world where I only knew _how to find out_ about things rather than information about the thing. In such a world, action preceeds knowledge. You have to do something to learn about it.

## The map
You, me, and everyone studying Economics 101 has heard the comparison of economic models with cartography. A model, much like a map, does not need be fully realistic to serve its purpose. In fact, if a map were fully realistic (e.g. 1:1 scale) it would completely fail to serve it's purpose (it wouldn't be able to fit in your pocket). Thus, if you spend every waking moment perfecting your map, you'll have no time for exploring the world and eventually, if you do perfect the map, it would be completely worthless.

This is what I mean about substituting doing something valuable with the endless, fruitless, chase of knowledge of that thing. This is what Elon Musk means when he says that we susceptible to "optimizing a thing that should simply not exist". This is what John McWhorter means about the woke individual that stands up and shows that they know something about societal racism but has done nothing to help somebody who is suffering.

First and foremost, this is a message directed to myself. If you also need to hear some encouragement, here it is:

_There is an abundance of information. You have a map. You know more than enough to get started. Just go. If you fail—good. Let the practical experience inform your next action. While you're at it, encourage others to do whatever they've been putting on hold lately._
