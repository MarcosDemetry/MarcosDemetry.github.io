## 1. Quick Recap ##
Wondered off from the poster and need a quick reminder about the project?
<img src="/assets/img/post-nfrd/recap.png" alt="Recap" width="100%"/>

- __What's this about?__ I am evaluating a 2017 Swedish sustainability reporting reform's effects on firms' financial outcomes, sustainability policies and sustainability outcomes.
- __How have I estimated this?__ I've used a Difference-in-Differences approach on all Swedish firms with more than 10 employees with regards to financial outcomes, and specifically, looked among listed firms for sustainability policies and outcomes. Additionally, I've created a proxy for compliance with the reform that's simple, intuitive and captures the essence of compliance.
- __What have I found?__ High compliance with the reform, some financial benefit in terms of greater sales, no effect on productivity (within-firm value-added), little to no changes in sustainability targets and sustainability outcomes.
- __Do I trust these results?__ Yes, with an asterisk. First, most robustness checks (as in Table 3 and 4 below) provide stable point estimates regardless of sample or exact definition of treatment. For the full sample, pre-trends are slightly unparallel, especially for value-added per employee, and we may thus violate the PTA. Therefore, as an additional analysis, I perform an RD design.

The results can be summarized as:

## 3. Alternative Design: Regression Discontinuity ##
<!-- The Regression Discontinuity Design relies on the fact that the reform has sharp cutoffs that are difficult to manipulate precisely.
Firstly, there are three paths into treatment given the three cutoffs ({1, 2}, {1,3}, {2, 3}). Hence, a firm with over 250 employees that would like to remain untreated would have to manipulate its books with 
regard to the balance sheet (i.e. total assets) _and_ net turnover. Secondly, the cutoffs are based on fulfilling criteria over a period of two years. So, for example, a firm that would like to stay under a net turnover of 350 million SEK 
would have to make sure to do so for one of the past two years to avoid SR this year. Overall, it is unlikely that a firm would harm its growth potential simply to avoid reporting on their sustainability policies. Thus, we would expect 
there to be no manipulation of treatment status.

### Identifying assumption
The main identifying assumption is continuity, i.e., in absence of treatment we would not see any discontinuities at the cutoff.
However, crossing the cutoff makes a firm switch from being untreated to treated, and therefore any jump in outcomes is directly attributable to being treated.

What this implies is that firms around the cutoff are as-if randomly assigned to treatment.
Or, to rephrase it, the main threat to the internal validity of this empirical design is if firms are able to precisely manipulate their size (in terms of number of employees, total assets and net turnover),
around a combination of cutoffs. Do we have reason to believe that this is the case?

First, Sweden has relatively strict Employment Protection Laws (EPL) that regulate employer-employee relations.
This implies that employees cannot be fired without reason. Employers could however choose not to expand by hiring employees.
However, for the purposes of this paper, it is unlikely that firms would downsize the number of employees or curb their growth in order to avoid complying with such a low-cost law.
Having said that, number of employees, as a running variable, is still the easiest to manipulate of the three variables.
Second, to avoid treatment, a firm would have to ensure that they are below the cutoff in at least two of the three running variables for size.
We have no reason to believe that firms could precisely manipulate their size in terms of at least two of three firm size variables, simply to avoid 
maintaining a sustainability report.

The validity of this assumption can be tested and backed up with circumstantial evidence. Specifically, we perform three types of robustness checks.
First, we check for bunching around the cutoff using histograms and a McCrary test in Appendix Figures~\ref{fig:rd_mccrary}, \ref{fig:rd_bunching_test}, \ref{fig:rd_bunching_by_period} and \ref{fig:rd_FS_by_treatment}.
For a given running variable, if we find that the distribution of firms differs drastically on either side of the cutoff (for example, due to bunching right below the cutoff), then that indicates 
that there may be manipulation of treatment status.
Second, we can test whether there is an RD treatment effect for pre-determined variables. If that is the case, then it casts doubt on any eventual effects found for the outcomes of interest.
Third, we can test whether placebo cutoffs also yield significant RD treatment effects. For example, we test whether the cutoff for number of employees at $c' \in \{50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 350\}$
would yield similar results as the true cutoff $c = 250$. This is true _unless_ there are other reforms that have these size cutoffs and affect our outcomes.
Thus, this is the weakest robustness check.

An alternative to evaluating each running variable separately is to use a standardized distance to cutoff as a running variable (see Appendix~\ref{app:var_construct}).

The main results of the RDD are presented in Table~\ref{tab:rd_main_results}, Figure~\ref{fig:rd_foradlvpanst}, and Figure~\ref{fig:rd_omspanst}.
Overall, there is no statistically significant effect of the reform on the main financial outcomes, similar to the results from the Difference-in-Differences.
Figure~\ref{fig:rd_bw_foradlvpanst} and Figure~\ref{fig:rd_bw_omspanst} show how the results vary with increasing the bandwidth from the MSE-optimal bandwidth.
As expected, the further away we move from the cutoff, the more the results vary. Overall, closest to the cutoff (and with the MSE-optimal bandwidth),
there is no significant difference between treated and untreated firms. 
Figures~\ref{fig:rd_annual_foradlvpanst} and \ref{fig:rd_annual_omspanst} show the RDD results estimated each year separately.
There is no clear pattern in the RDD estimates per year. -->
