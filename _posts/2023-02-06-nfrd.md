## 1. Quick Recap ##
Wondered off from the poster and need a quick reminder about the project?
<img src="/assets/img/post-nfrd/recap-vertical.png" alt="Recap" width="100%"/>

- __What's this about?__ I am evaluating a 2017 Swedish sustainability reporting reform's effects on firms' financial outcomes, sustainability policies and sustainability outcomes.
- __How have I estimated this?__ I've used a Difference-in-Differences approach on all Swedish firms with more than 10 employees with regards to financial outcomes, and specifically, looked among listed firms for sustainability policies and outcomes. Additionally, I've created a proxy for compliance with the reform that's simple, intuitive and captures the essence of compliance.
- __What have I found?__ High compliance with the reform, some financial benefit in terms of greater sales, no effect on productivity (within-firm value-added), little to no changes in sustainability targets and sustainability outcomes.
- __Do I trust these results?__ Yes, with an asterisk. First, most robustness checks point (as in Table 3 and 4 below) provide stable point estimates regardless of sample or exact definition of treatment. For the full sample, pre-trends are slightly unparallel, especially for value-added per employee, and we may thus violate the PTA. Therefore, as an additional analysis, I perform an RD design.

- Would you a priori have expected positive, null or negative effects on financial outcomes from having a sustainability report?
Let me know what you think!
