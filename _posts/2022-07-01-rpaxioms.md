## Abstract
The revealed preference approach in economics is central to the empirical analysis of consumer behavior. In this article, we introduce the __Stata commands__
checkax, aei, and powerps as a bundle within the package rpaxioms. The first command allows a user to __test__ whether consumer expenditure data satisfy several
__revealed preference axioms__; the second command calculates measures of __goodness of fit__ when the data violate these axioms; and the third command calculates
__power against uniformly random behavior__ as well as predictive success for each axiom. We illustrate the commands using individual-level experimental data and
household-level aggregate consumption data.
