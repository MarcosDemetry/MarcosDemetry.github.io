### 1. Testing Aximoms of Revealed Preference in Stata

Abstract:
This paper introduces the __Stata commands__ checkax, aei, and powers as a bundle within the package rpaxioms. The first command allows the user to __test__ whether __consumer demand data__ satisfy a number of revealed preference axioms at a given efficiency level, the second command calculates measures of __goodness-of-fit__ when the data violate these axioms, and the third command calculates __power against uniformly random behavior__ as well as predictive success for each axiom at any given efficiency level. The commands are illustrated using experimental individual-level data and aggregated household-level consumption data.

### 2. Segregation in Urban Areas

Abstract:
This literature review outlines research on how individual preferences can lead to segregation, even in the absence of discriminatory policy and other constraints. From __Thomas Schelling__’s (1971) __Spatial Proximity__ model comes the theoretical conclusion that moderate preferences for own-group neighbors (e.g. immigrants or natives) may lead to complete segregation between the two groups over time. Schelling’s __Bounded Neighborhood__ model provides the theoretical conclusion that the stable equilibrium reached (e.g. an ‘all immigrant’ or ‘all native’ neighborhood) ultimately depends on the initial distribution of agents and their relative speeds of movement. This is because in the unstable, integrated, equilibrium an apparently insignificant event can set in motion an irreversible process toward segregation by tipping the distribution one way or another. Both models highlight how well-intentioned individual preferences may result in undesirable aggregate outcomes, whereby good intentions and some level tolerance toward others are not enough to prevent the self-segregation mechanism. The review also covers several __key empirical applications__ and limitations in research in this field.
