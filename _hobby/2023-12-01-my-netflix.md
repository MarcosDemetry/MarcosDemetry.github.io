Is there any greater sign of procras... being cultured than watching good TV?
If I'm not listening to music (which was 55.8k minutes so far in 2023) or watching podcasts on YouTube (like the trifecta Lex Fridman, Joe Rogan, Andrew Huberman, with a little Theo Von, Whitney Cummings, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, and Sean Carroll sprinkled on top), then I have a show or movie running in the background on Netflix.

In an attempt to make this truly beautifully unnecessary statistics, I give you a summary of my Netflix viewing activity.

Surprisingly, I played outside more in the beginning of the pandemic (March–July of 2020), than I did toward the end of that year.
I seem to be getting a cold in December–February of every year, so viewing times really shoot up during that period.

What have I watched the most? If I look at movies and series together (i.e. removing episode information from title), I get these excellent shows on my top 20.
And I'll throw in a little WordCloud while we're at it to capture a few more titles than the top 20.

What's more interesting is seeing when I've watched these series. For the top 10, you see that I've rewatched Community at least 3 times, and likewise had 3–4 bursts of viewing B99. Arrested Development on the other hand is just always in my life. Every once in a while, I'll rewatch the first 3 episodes. For Narcos, I watched the 3 seasons as they came out, then jumped on the Narcos Mexico series as it came out as well (starting November 2018).

If we instead let series episodes compete with movies, then this is what the top 20 looks like.

For my top 30, a quick run using the [IMDB/Cinemagoer](https://cinemagoer.github.io) Python library, gives me the following
information on genres, ratings and release years.

One day, I may take these BUS seriously. Today is not that day.
